= Lib-common

The lib-common is an Intersec libc extension targeting Linux environments. It
provides most of the basic tools a C programmer can expect such as:

* a string manipulation library
* containers like dynamic vectors, hash tables, hash maps, lists...
* bitmask manipulation functions
* endianness conversion primitives
* ...

It also contains higher level libraries:

* asynchronous event loop
* http client and server implementations
* RPC communication channels
* optimized allocators for our use cases
* log file management
* tracing and reporting primitives
* program argument parser
* ASN1 parser / writer
* ...

It is also the home of our IOP library. The IOP (Intersec Object Packer) is a
framework to serialize structured data to use in communications protocols, data
storage... IOP is language independent. IOP objects are encoded using TLV
(Tag-Length-Value) packers/un-packers.  The IOP concept is similar to the
Google Protocol Buffers.

The IOP library is used to transmit data over the network in a safe manner. It
deals with data integrity checking, retro-compatibility issues,... They are also
used to exchange data between different languages or to provide a generic
interface to store and load C data on disk.

== Documentation

The lib-common documentation can be found in the `docs` directory. The
documentation is based on https://antora.org[Antora], an online version is
available https://intersec.github.io/lib-common/lib-common/index.html[here].

== Quickstart

This section offers basic instructions for building the lib-common.

=== Prerequisites

The lib-common is mainly written in C, with some extensions coming from clang
features. So its main dependencies are:

glibc:: used extensively, in particular to interface with various Linux kernel
facilities
clang:: base compiler
waf:: build system
cython:: to build the IOP python interface
openssl:: various cryptography requirements
flex:: IOP syntax lexer at https://github.com/westes/flex
gperf:: GNU library for perfect hash function generation at
https://www.gnu.org/software/gperf

Most of dependencies can be installed using your own Linux distribution
packages, with the exception of waf which is usually not packaged.

=== waf installation

The lib-common build system uses https://waf.io/[waf]. If you want to
understand how it works, you should read the https://waf.io/book/[Waf Book],
but this is not necessary if you just want to use it.

All the lib-common specificities and custom rules are defined in `waf` tools,
located in the `build/waftools` directory.

The main entry point of the build system is the `wscript` file located at
top-level of the repository. It loads the Intersec tools, defines the main
`configure` and `build` functions, and recurses in sub-directories (that
contain their own `wscript` or `wscript_build` files).

The waftools and wscript files are supposed to be readable and documented when
needed.

`waf` can be downloaded as a single executable or built from sources, as
described in the https://waf.io/book/[waf documentation].

The simplest approach is to https://waf.io/[download the waf executable] and
install it in a directory already in your PATH environment, for example
`/usr/local/bin`:
---------------------------------
$ cd /usr/local/bin
$ wget https://waf.io/waf-2.0.x
$ ln -s waf-2.0.x waf
$ chmod +x waf-2.0.x
$ ./waf
---------------------------------

`waf` versions 2.0.8 and 2.0.18 are known to work fine, running the latest 2.0.x
`waf` should also work fine.

=== Cython

To build the IOP python interface component, cython >= 0.29 is required. It can
be installed using pip:

---------------------------------
$ pip install cython
---------------------------------

To also build the python3 IOP interface:

---------------------------------
$ pip3 install cython
---------------------------------

=== List of packages per Linux distribution

==== Debian 9, Debian 10 or Ubuntu 18.04

You need to install the following packages to build the lib-common:

---------------------------------
$ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip flex gperf pkg-config exuberant-ctags libxml2-dev libssl-dev valgrind
---------------------------------

To generate the python3 IOP interface, you also need the following packages:
---------------------------------
$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip
---------------------------------

==== Fedora 31

You need to install the following packages to build the lib-common:

---------------------------------
$ sudo dnf install clang clang-devel flex gperf libxml2-devel openssl-devel valgrind-devel python2-devel
---------------------------------

To generate the python3 IOP interface, you also need the following package:
---------------------------------
$ sudo dnf install python3-devel
---------------------------------

=== Building lib-common

First of all, you have to configure your project, by running in the top-level
directory:
---------------------------------
$ waf configure --check-c-compiler=clang --check-cxx-compiler=clang++
---------------------------------

Note the two options `--check-xxx-compiler`, in order to compile with clang,
which is the easiest way to compile the lib-common. If you prefer compiling
with gcc, refer to the dedicated section below.

If the configuration step triggers no error, then you are ready to build,
which just consists in running:
----------------------------------
$ waf
or
$ waf build
----------------------------------

You can run it from a sub-directory in order to build only the targets defined
in this directory and its sub-directories (and its dependencies).

All the available targets can be listed with this command:
----------------------------------
$ waf list
----------------------------------

It is possible to build only a specific target, or a list of targets, by
running, from anywhere in the repository:
----------------------------------
$ waf --targets=target1,target2
----------------------------------

==== Other Intersec-specific waf commands

Other commands are listed with `waf --help`. Here they are:

* `waf check`: run the tests of the current directory (defined in the `ZFile`)
               and in its sub-directories.
               The following variants also exist (cf `waf --help` for the
               details): `fast-check`, `www-check`, `selenium`,
               `fast-selenium`.
* `waf tags`: generate tags using ctags.
* `waf etags`: generate tags for emacs using ctags.
* `waf pylint`: run pylint checks on committed python files.
* `old-gen-files-detect`: detect old files generated by a previous build
                          system run.
* `old-gen-files-delete`: delete the files detected by the previous command.
* `coverage-start`: start a coverage session (requires coverage profile).
                    This resets the coverage counters. After running this
                    command, you can run some code and use the `coverage-end`
                    command to produce a coverage report.
                    Note that this is done when configuring the project.
* `coverage-end`: end a coverage session and produce a report.

==== Supported environment variables

The following environment variables can be used at the configuration phase:

`P` (string)::
    Specify the desired compilation profile (default, debug, release, ...).
    The complete list of available profiles is defined in
    `build/waftools/backend.py`, variable `PROFILES`.
    If not specified, the default profile is `default`.

`NOCHECK` (boolean)::
    The build-system doesn't run "check" targets, which are:
      * clang check of c files.
      * linters on js/ts files.
    You may want to set it to speedup the build.
    You can also bypass the checks thanks to the `nocheck` parameter of
    task-generators, which can be `True` to bypass the checks of all the
    source files, or a list of files to not check.

`NOCOMPRESS` (boolean)::
    If set, the build-system doesn't compress the debug section of binaries
    leading to larger binary files. This can be used if you have to work
    with tools that does not support compressed-debug sections (like
    valgrind, pahole or some old version of gdb).
    You may also want to set it to speedup the build.
    This is ignored in release profile.

`NO_DOUBLE_FPIC` (boolean)::
    If set, the compilation will be faster, but the produced binaries will be
    larger and the runtime performances will be affected.
    Cf. `build/waftools/backend.py` for the details.
    This is ignored in release profile.

`FAKE_VERSIONS` (boolean)::
    If set, the version files are generated with fake (and constant) data, so
    that changing of git revision does not trigger a re-link of all the
    binaries. This is a huge gain of time, but it's not possible to know the
    revision of the binaries that are built with this flag.
    This is ignored in release profile.

`SHARED_LIBRARY_SANITIZER` (boolean)::
    If set, the shared libraries will also be compiled with the sanitizer
    specified by the profile.
    You will have to use `LD_PRELOAD` or use a process that is compiled with
    the same sanitizer to load the compiled shared libraries with this option.
    This is only available for profiles that use sanitizers, i.e. asan or
    tsan.

==== Compiling with gcc

It is possible to compile the lib-common with gcc instead of clang if you
prefer, but this is a bit harder.

An important part of the lib-common uses the
https://clang.llvm.org/docs/BlockLanguageSpec.html[blocks] clang extension,
that is not supported by gcc.

Because of this, we have put in place a two-phase build of some files
(named `foo.blk` instead of `foo.c`) that are pre-compiled using a patched
clang that generates gcc-compilable C code to support blocks. gcc is then
used to produce the final object code.

The patched clang has to be built from this clang fork:
https://github.com/Intersec/clang/tree/clang/7.0/maint and placed in your
PATH environment.

Then, just configure the project without specifying the compiler
(default is gcc):
---------------------------------
$ waf configure
---------------------------------
