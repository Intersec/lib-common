# FIXME: in previous version of iopy we had a clever way of compiling iopy
# into two different libraries iopy2.so for python2 and iopy3.so for python3,
# and allow the module to also be able to be loaded as iopy.so with a symlink.
# Unfortunately, this is is not currently possible with cython because the
# python module name is dependent of the cython .pyx file name.
# So we just use python2 for now and we hope that we can fix it later.
