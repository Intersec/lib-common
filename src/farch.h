 *
 * Farch is used to store compressed file contents as C obfuscated symbols.
 *
 * File contents are obfuscated by splitting them in small chunks which are
 * xored with a randomly selected string (the string is a symbol which, in
 * principle, already exists in the binary). Each chunk is represented as a
 * farch_data_t structure.
 *
 * A farch archive is an array of farch_entry_t. Each of those represents a
 * single file with its obfuscated filename, its contents as described above,
 * and the size of the contents after and before compression. The obfuscation
 * method for the filename is the same than for the contents.
