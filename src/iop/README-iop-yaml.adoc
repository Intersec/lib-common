IOP YAML Documentation
----------------------

This document describes the supported YAML syntax for IOP serialization/deserialization.

== Description

The syntax is based on https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html[YAML 1.2], but as the full spec
is overly complex, *a lot* of simplifications have been applied, as well as a few custom
improvements.

* No declarations.
* Only alphanumeric keys starting with a letter are allowed: `[a-zA-Z]\w*`.
* Types only allowed for IOP classes.
* No anchors or references (yet, could be added in the future).

== Mapping with IOP concepts

=== Scalars

* Booleans are written `true` or `false`.
* Integers: `154`, `-23`.
* Floating-point numbers: `-15.23`.
** Special values are handled: `.Inf`, `-.Inf`, `.NaN`.
* Null can be expressed with `null` or `~`
* Strings can be written as is in most cases, but must be quoted if:
** it starts with `!`, `&`, `*`, `-`, `"`, `.`, `[` or `{`.
** it contains `:`, `#`, or non printable ascii characters.
* When a string is quoted, some escape codes are handled:
** `\a`, `\b`, `\e`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\v`, `\"` and `\\` for classic
   printf escape codes.
** `\uXX`, `\uYYY` and `\uZZZZ` are interpreted as an UTF-8 code point.

[source,YAML]
----
foo: Yes, I am a valid string
bar: +0.5ab also me
baz: "- I have to be escaped"
addr: "127.0.0.1:80"
----

* It is also possible to use binary data with the `!bin` tag. In that
  case, the data must be written in base64.

[source,YAML]
----
data: !bin ewogICJmb28iOiAyCn0K
----

=== Arrays

Arrays are written with every element on its own line, prefixed by a dash, with the same indentation:

[source,YAML]
----
array:
  - foo
  - 5
  - baz
objects:
  - name: abe
    age: 24
  - name: boo
    age: 72
----

They can also be written inline using `[` and `]`:

[source,YAML]
----
array: [foo, 5, baz]
----

Only a limited subset of data can be used inside this syntax however:
[source,YAML]
----
[
    # Scalars are allowed, but ',' and ']' now ends strings:
    string one,
    "string, two",
    # A key mapping will generate an object with this single mapping:
    key: value,
    # Additional inline sequences can be used:
    [ foo, ~, ],
    # Inline objects can be used:
    { a: b, c: d }
]
----

=== Struct

The fields of the struct should be written out, one of each line, with the same indentation:

[source,YAML]
----
struct:
  foo: 5
  bar: aa
----

An inline syntax can be used as well:

[source,YAML]
----
struct: { foo: 5, bar: aa }
----

See the inline sequence description for which values can be used in the inline syntax.

=== Class

A class has the same syntax as a struct, but must be prefixed by its fullname as a type:

[source,YAML]
----
class: !aaa.bbb.MyClass
  foo: 5
  bar: aa
----

=== Empty/Default value

Sometimes, we simply want to indicate the presence of a field, or to use all default values:

* For a field of type void, the `~` value should be used.
* For an object with no keys, the `{}` syntax must be used.
* For an array with no elements, the `[]` syntax must be used.

[source,YAML]
----
obj:
  voidField: ~
  emptyStruct: {}
  emptyArray: []
----

== Includes

Other YAML files can be included using the `!include` syntax:

[source,YAML]
----
obj:
  key: !include:foo.yml
----

The YAML data declared in this file will be inlined in place of the
`!include:<path>`.

It is also possible to include files of any type:

[source,YAML]
----
obj:
  key: !includeraw:foo.json
----

The `!includeraw` will be replaced by a binary data holding the whole content
of the included file.

WARNING: Only includes from the same directory (or from subdirectories) are
allowed. Includes from absolute paths or from parent directories are
rejected, as they cannot be repacked in the same way safely.

== Overrides

YAML data included from other files can be modified locally. This is done
by specifying an object after the include:

[source,YAML]
----
obj: !include:foo.yml
  key: 3
  obj:
    a: 4
    b: 5
  seq:
    - 1
    - 2
----

The merge of the two objects are quite limited for the moment. Here are
the few rules to know:

- The included data must be an object, it cannot be a scalar or a
sequence.

- The structure of the override must match the structure of the
included data.  For example, if `inner.yml` is:

[source,YAML]
----
key: 1
obj:
  a: 2
  b: 3
seq:
  - 4
  - 5
----

Then:

[source,YAML]
----
inner: !include:inner.yml
  obj: 2
----

is invalid, because obj is an object and not a scalar. Matching
any scalar type with any other scalar type is however fine.

- If a key is not found in the included object: it is added:

[source,YAML]
----
inner: !include:inner.yml
  foo: foo
----

will add the key `foo` in the object (which will have 4 keys: `key`, `obj`,
`seq` and `foo`).

- If a key is found, we will merge the content of the key from the override
  with the content of the key from the included object.

[source,YAML]
----
inner: !include:inner.yml
  obj:
    c: 4
----

will add the key `c` in the `obj` object (which will have 3 keys: `a`, `b`
and `c`).

- If a sequence object is being merged, it is appended to the included sequence.

[source,YAML]
----
inner: !include:inner.yml
  seq:
    - ~
----

will add the nil scalar to the `seq` sequence (which will have 3 elements:
`4`, `5` and `~`).

To put it all together, keeping our `inner.yml` example, if we use this
override:

[source,YAML]
----
inner: !include:inner.yml
  key: -1
  obj:
    c: c
    a: a
  seq:
    - ~
----

We will end up with the following object:

[source,YAML]
----
inner:
  key: -1
  obj:
    a: a
    b: 3
    c: c
  seq:
    - 4
    - 5
    - ~
----

== Variables

Variables can be used in a document, and specified when including it. This
allows direct modification of any data inside the document, without having to
specify the full path as in an override. It also allows modification of multiple
data with a single variable.

Here is an example, for `inner.yml`:

[source,YAML]
----
raw: $(raw)
str1: variable a is `$(a)` and b is `$(b)`
a: $(a)
ab: "$(a): $(b)"
----

The variables can then be set by specifying their values after including the file:

[source,YAML]
----
!include:inner.yml
variables:
  a: 5
  b: bee
  raw:
    - 1
    - s: s
      z: z
----

This will give the following object:

[source,YAML]
----
!include:inner.yml
raw:
  - 1
  - s: s
    z: z
str1: variable a is `5` and b is `bee`
a: 5
ab: "5: bee"
----

Variables that are used inside a string (like `a` and `b`) must be scalars.
Otherwise, the variable can be any type of data (like `raw`).

To use `$(` in a string without declaring a variable, the sequence must be escaped:

[source,YAML]
----
# This is simply a string equals to `$(a)`
str1: "\$(a)"

# This is a \ character followed by a variable
# escaping only works in quotes
str2: \$(a)
----

Additionally, variables cannot be used in any variable expressions, or in overrides:

[source,YAML]
----
!include:inner.yml
variables:
  var: $(foo) # This is not allowed
field:
  val: $(bar) # Not allowed either
----

== Merge keys

A merge key can be used to inline multiple objects into one. For example:

[source,YAML]
----
<<:
  a: 1
  b: 2
a: 3
c: 4
----

This is equivalent to:

[source,YAML]
----
a: 3
b: 2
c: 4
----

This can be useful with includes. Set of parameters can be moved in separate
files, and then included in an object using a merge key:

[source,YAML]
----
<<:
  - !include:feature_1.yml
  - !include:feature_2.yml
  - !include:feature_3.yml
foo: bar
...
----

The merging rules are very simple:

- if a key already exists in the object, the value is overwrote by the
  new value. This is the case for `a` in the example above.
- Otherwise, the key is added in the object.

If the merge key contains a list of objects, they are merged in order,
so the first object will add keys, and the subsequent objects will modify
those keys.

For example:

[source,YAML]
----
<<:
  - { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 }
  - { a: 2, b: 2, d: 2 }
a: 3
e: 3
----

This is equivalent to:

[source,YAML]
----
a: 3
b: 2
c: 1
d: 2
e: 3
----

- key `a` is added by the first object, then modified by the second one,
  then finally modified after the merge key.
- key `b` is added by the first object, then modified by the second one.
- key `c` is added by the first object.
- key `d` is added by the second object.
- key `e` is added after the merge key.

NOTE: The merge key *must* be the first key of the object.
