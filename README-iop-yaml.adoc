IOP YAML Documentation
----------------------

This document describes the supported YAML syntax for IOP serialization/deserialization.

== Description

The syntax is based on https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html[YAML 1.2], but as the full spec
is overly complex, *a lot* of simplifications have been applied, as well as a few custom
improvements.

A better way to describe the supported syntax would be that it follows the
https://github.com/openbohemians/diet-yaml[Diet YAML] simplification, but keeps type
syntax for IOP classes descriptions:

* No declarations
* Only scalar keys
* Types only allowed for IOP classes
* No anchors or references (yet, could be added in the future).

== Mapping with IOP concepts

=== Scalars

* Booleans are written `true` or `false`.
* Numbers can be written in many ways:
** Decimal: `154`, `-154.56`, `+0.`
** Octal: `0777`
** Hexadecimal: `0xDADA`
** Arithmetic computations: `1 + 2 << 10`
** Binary prefixes: `500K`
* Null can be expressed with `null` or `~`
* As long as it does not start with `-` or contains a `:`, a string can be written as is,
  otherwise, it must be surrounded by quotes:

[source,YAML]
----
foo: Yes, I am a valid string
bar: +0.5ab also me
baz: "- I have to be escaped"
addr: "127.0.0.1:80"
----

=== Arrays

Arrays are written with every element on its own line, prefixed by a dash, with the same indentation:

[source,YAML]
----
- name: foo
  bar: 5
- name: baz
----

=== Struct

The fields of the struct should be written out, one of each line, with the same indentation:

[source,YAML]
----
struct:
  foo: 5
  bar: aa
----

=== Class

A class has the same syntax as a struct, but must be prefixed by its fullname as a type:

[source,YAML]
----
class: !aaa.bbb.MyClass
  foo: 5
  bar: aa
----

=== Empty/Default value

Sometimes, we simply want to indicate the presence of a field, or to use all default values:

* Specify the key of a union, that has no value. In JSON, this looks like `"a": null`.
* Specify a struct, but without specifying any value. In JSON, this looks like `"a": {}`

For those cases, it is possible to use the `~` character, but also the `null` string.

[source,YAML]
----
obj:
  field: ~
  union:
    key: ~
----

== IOP YAML Grammar

[source,EBNF]
----
yaml     = data
data     = [ space+ ] scalar | sequence | obj
scalar   = (nil | boolean | number | string) "\n"
sequence = indent "-" data { "\n" ?same-indent? "-" data }
obj      = [ "!" [a-zA-Z\.]+ ] [ space+ | "\n" ] raw-obj
raw-obj  = indent key ":" data { "\n" ?same-indent? key ":" data }
string   = '"' .* '"' | [^-] + 
key      = [a-zA-Z]+
number   = <see above>
boolean  = "true" | "false"
nil      = "~" | "null"
indent   = space+
space    = " "
