## What is IOPy

IOPy is a python module extension used to interact with Intersec products and
create IOP objects in Python.

Starting with the version 4, IOPy uses Cython.
To see what Cython is and for more documentation, see https://cython.org/

Some tricky parts of Cython include:

- Cython extension types:
https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/extension_types.html

- Exception handling for cdef functions:
https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/language_basics.html#error-return-values

- String types for Python 2 and 3, we use `basestring` to be fully compatible:
https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/strings.html


## How Cython is used in IOPy

To export the C types and symbols from lib-common to IOPy, we use PXCC with
the file `libcommon_cython.pxc`.
See pxcc/README.md for more explanation about PXCC.

All the IOPy exposed classes and all the code that manipulate Python objects
are handled by Cython in `iopy.pyx`.

The RPC communication and event loop thread are handled in `iopy_rpc.c`. It
does not and never should manipulate Python objects.

## How to debug

Cython will generate a C file `iopy.pyx.c` from `iopy.pyx`.
It is encouraged to see the code generated by Cython to make sure the C
variables are well manipulated.

Since Cython generates a C file, we can debug `iopy.so` with the standard GDB.
Example:
```

$ gdb --args python z_iopy.py

Cython also provides a wrapper to demangle Cython symbol names, but are
currently some conflict with the installed GDB version and Python on standard
Intersec debian.
