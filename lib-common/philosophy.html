<p>Intersec grew on its ability to build high quality software: it outperforms
competitor&#8217;s solutions in terms of performance and hardware requirements. This
is the consequence of the philosophical and technical choices around which
Intersec was founded: the <em>KISS</em> principle.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_kiss"><a class="anchor" href="#_kiss"></a>KISS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>KISS stands for <em>Keep It Simple, Stupid</em>. This mantra is our guideline, it
expresses our will to avoid unneeded complexity. <em>simple</em> here is a synonym for
<em>pure</em>, and an antonym for both <em>complex</em> and <em>simplistic</em>: a perfect software
is a software that is a minimalist response to the needs, both in terms of
design and code. As said by Antoine de Saint Exupéry: <em>La perfection est
atteinte, non pas lorsqu&#8217;il n&#8217;y a plus rien à ajouter, mais lorsqu&#8217;il n&#8217;y a
plus rien à retirer</em>. Another way to express this is <em>Simplicity is the
ultimate sophistication</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is much harder to make something powerful that looks simple than something
complex that does very few things. The KISS principle should drive our choices
to the simplest solution that fits our needs. Our engineering force should go
into making simple-looking software that hides really powerful capabilities.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_simple_design"><a class="anchor" href="#_simple_design"></a>Simple design</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When designing software, we focus our energy on making the whole design as
simple and consistent as possible. A consistent design where all the components
naturally interact with each other is the ultimate goal. We apply the
module-oriented programming model to properly separate each functionality in
its own code module, creating a natural code structure that reflects the
component-based design. You should be able to explain your design using only a
few short sentences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a properly designed software, every component is clearly defined and each
functional role is assigned to the right component. Then components are plugged
together in a homogeneous product where every workflow is both completely
defined and easily understandable. This defines the readability of a design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Performance of the product is a consequence of the right design choices: if
performance is taken into account in the design from the start, the software
will perform great. Performance comes from designs that avoid useless network
trips, avoid useless disk accesses, cache the results of expensive operations,
&#8230;&#8203; Such considerations should be identified and weighted during the design
process.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_simple_ui"><a class="anchor" href="#_simple_ui"></a>Simple UI</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The UI should be easy to understand and use while still being expressive enough
to expose the richness of the product. When designing UIs (or just UI
components), we must be sure to place the user at the center of the interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interface should be designed in order to lower the learning curve. The user
should understand the interface on the first sight in order to be productive
from the very first minutes. Hard-to-understand concepts should be avoided: the
UI should be understandable without training or documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The UI should be consistent, provide enough feedback to the user and should be
smooth in addition of being visually appealing. We must be careful of always
providing the user with the right amount of information: too much information
kills the readability of the interface, while too few information forces the
user to navigate on multiple pages to collect the data he is looking for. We
must also ensure the navigation in the UI is easy and intuitive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The UI design rules should apply to all the pages of the UI: from the user
login page to the administrative (and debug) pages.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_simple_api"><a class="anchor" href="#_simple_api"></a>Simple API</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>APIs are what we give to others to communicate with us. APIs may be internal or
exposed in the product&#8217;s SDK, but in both cases we want them to remain simple
because the simpler your API is, the less error-prone it will be. Conceiving a
good API is the art of hiding powerful features in a simple shell. It&#8217;s a
challenge of expressiveness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good API is easy to understand, the API documentation may look obvious. It
must also offer one single correct way to achieve a task, guaranteeing that if
used by various developers, the API will always be used the same way. It must
be consistent with other existing APIs in order to avoid confusions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is often preferable to have API defining as few functions or RPC as possible
in order to make the API easier to master.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The naming of the API is an important part of a good API design. Names should
be kept as short as possible while still being identifiable and understandable.
Clean names avoid useless abbreviations and focus on finding the most precise
wording for every function and RPC. Too generic names must be avoided since
they tend to be applied to a lot of different concepts, causing confusion.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_simple_code"><a class="anchor" href="#_simple_code"></a>Simple code</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lib-common team imposes strict coding rules on how the code is formated.
These coding rules are aimed at code consistency and readability: this removes
the freedom of how the code is formated from the developper for the sake of
greater maintainability. The developper can then focus his creativity on the
design and on the code itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Code follows the KISS principle by avoiding useless optimisations: early
optimisation is evil and only causes subtle bugs that will strike back the day
the team will be on vacation. So keep our code as simple as possible: it is
useless to micro-optimise some code if it is not identified as being a
bottleneck. That said, <em>simple</em> does not mean <em>simplistic</em>: our code must be
conceived to perform well even on workloads that are one or two orders of
magnitude greater than the requirements of the (internal or external) customer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes code can be identified in advance as being a possible bottleneck. In
that case, the design can be performance-driven by defining the performance
level we want to reach and writing the simplest code that reaches that level.
All in all, this is just another application of the KISS principle with
performance being one of the requirements.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_simple_language"><a class="anchor" href="#_simple_language"></a>Simple language</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The C language allows us to reach our performance targets by avoiding all the
abstraction layers that get added by more modern languages. The C language is
both very close to the hardware and syntactically simple. This comes at some
cost such as the absence of automatic memory management or meta-programming,
but gives us the opportunity to fine-tune the code to our needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the lack of guidance (and the presence of implementation-defined
behaviours) in the C language specification, the language is hard to fully
master and requires precise and rigorous coding habits. It also lets us easily
customise our working environment by adding standard library extensions that
fit our needs.</p>
