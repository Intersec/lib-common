= IOP inheritance
:toc: :numbered:

== Introduction

Inheritance is supported since _iopc_ v3, and lib-common 2013.2.

The idea is to be able to declare classes, which are a kind of structure in
which fields are inherited.  A class can have a parent (in that case it
inherits of the fields of his parent, and of all his ancestors), or be a
_master class_ (ie. without parent).  A class can also have static fields,
which are class constants.

== Declaration in IOP files

=== Syntax and vocabulary

To declare a class in an IOP file, the syntax is the following:

[source,java]
----

[abstract][local] class MyClass [: classId [: parentClass]] {
    static int staticInt [= 2];
1:  string name;
};

----

Here is a description of all the elements:

* the `class` keyword is used to declare a class,
* the `abstract` keyword can be used to declare a class that cannot be
  instantiated: init, packing and unpacking are (more or less violently)
  forbidden,
* the `local` keyword can also be used to declare a class from what it is
  impossible to inherit without being in the same package than it,
* the `classId` (0 by default) is a numerical identifier which *MUST* be unique
  in a whole inheritance tree. This is partially checked by _iopc_ at compile
  time, but cannot be fully checked in case of multi-packages inheritance. In
  any case, collisions on class ids will be detected at runtime,
* the `parentClass` is the name... of the parent class. Multiple inheritance is
  not supported; in other words, a class can have 0 or 1 parent, but not more,
* the `static` keyword is used to declare class constant fields. Here are the
  things to know about static fields:
** it must not have an explicit tag, since it is never packed in binary,
** it must have a default value for non-abstract classes (which will be the
value for all the instances of this class),
** a class can redefine a static field of one of its ancestors, but obviously
it must have the same type,
** for abstract classes, the default value can be omitted. This means that all
the direct non-abstract children MUST define this static field.
* fields are declared exactly as in structures, but a field cannot have the
  same name as a field of an ancestor.

Such a class can be reused as a field in another class, a structure or a union.

=== Example

A quite exhaustive example can be found in
_lib-common/iop/tstiop_inheritance.iop_, but here is a more simple example that
will be reused later in this documentation:

[source,java]
----

package test;

class A1 {
    static string name = "a1";
    int a = 10;
};

class B1 : 1 : A1 {
    string b;
};

class B2 : 2 : A1 {
    static string name = "b2";
    bool b;
};

struct ClassContainer {
    A1   classContainerA1;
    B1?  classContainerB1;
    B2[] classContainerB2;
};

----

=== Dealing with backward compatibility

Inside a class definition, the rules to guarantee backward compatibility are
the sames as xref:base.adoc#backward-compat[explained for the structures].

For class, changing the class id obviously breaks the backward compatibility.

Removing a class from an inheritance tree is also a backward-incompatible
change, but adding a class not having any mandatory fields is. For example, the
following change in our previous example is OK:

[source,java]
----

package test;

class A1 {
    static string name = "a1";
    int a = 10;
};

class A11 : 3 : A1 {
    static string name = "a11";
    int a11 = 11;
};

class B1 : 1 : A11 {
    string b;
};

class B2 : 2 : A11 {
    static string name = "b2";
    bool b;
};

----

== Inheritance in C

=== Generated C objects

The IOP example file just above would be translated this way in C:
[source,c]
----

typedef struct test__a1__t {
    const iop_struct_t *__vptr;
    int32_t  a;
} test__a1__t;
extern iop_struct_t const test__a1__s;
IOP_CLASS(test__a1);

typedef struct test__b1__t {
    struct {
        const iop_struct_t *__vptr;
        /* fields of test__a1__t */
        int32_t  a;
    };
    lstr_t   b;
} test__b1__t;
extern iop_struct_t const test__b1__s;
IOP_CLASS(test__b1);

typedef struct test__b2__t {
    struct {
        const iop_struct_t *__vptr;
        /* fields of test__a1__t */
        int32_t  a;
    };
    bool     b;
} test__b2__t;
extern iop_struct_t const test__b2__s;
IOP_CLASS(test__b2);

typedef struct test__class_container__t {
    struct test__a1__t *class_container_a1;
    struct test__b1__t *class_container_b1;
    IOP_ARRAY_OF(struct test__b2__t *) class_container_b2;
} test__class_container__t;
extern iop_struct_t const test__class_container__s;
IOP_GENERIC(test__class_container);

----

As you can see, classes are translated into structures, containing a pointer
`__vptr` on the IOP structure description of the instantiated object (can be
the class itself or one of its children). Most of time, this pointer should
not be accessed directly, and in any case it should *not* be modified.

Note that if a class has a parent, the fields of his parent (and all his
ancestors) are wrapped at the beginning in an anonymous structure, so that they
are directly accessible, and so that the types of a class and one of his
ancestors are compatible.

Also note that `IOP_CLASS` is used instead of `IOP_GENERIC` (which is used for
a struct or a union). This generates the same helpers as IOP_GENERIC, but with
a slightly different signature for some of them.

And finally, one *very important* remark about class fields in class
containers: such fields are always pointed, mandatory or not.

=== Initialization of a class object

The initialization of a class object is done like it's done for an IOP
structure, using the `__init` helper:

[source,c]
----

test__b2__t b2;

iop_init(test__b2, &b2);

----

This inits the fields to their default value, *AND* sets the `__vptr` pointer
to the correct value.

=== Initialization of a class container

As seen above, class fields in class containers are always pointed in the C
generated structure, and that's why initialization of class containers must be
done *very carefully*.

To take the example of the `ClassContainer` structure defined just above,
calling `iop_init(test__class_container, ...)` will set the
`class_container_a1` pointer to NULL, and trying to pack it just after would
be invalid since `A1` is a mantatory field in `ClassContainer`
(the consequence will be a crash).

To get a fully valid `ClassContainer` instance, the `a1` pointer should be
manually set to a valid `A1` class instance (or one of its children).

=== Accessing the static fields

Access to the static fields of a class can be done using the `iop_get_cvar`
function (or the `iop_get_cvar_cst` helper).  Cf. the documentation in
`lib-common/iop.h` for more details.

=== Casts

As briefly explained above, C types are compatible between an instantiated
class and his ancestors.  The lib-common is providing helpers to dynamically
cast a class instance to a compatible type, and to check this compatibility:
this is `iop_obj_vcast`/`iop_obj_ccast` and `iop_obj_is_a`.

As an example, let's suppose you just unpacked a binary stream containing an A1
object (we'll see how to do it later), and would like to do a special treatment
if this object is actually a B2 object (or a child) AND if its `b` field is
true. Here is how to do that:

[source,c]
----

test__a1__t *a1;

... unpack ...

if (iop_obj_is_a(a1, test__b1)) {
    const test__b2__t *b2 = iop_obj_ccast(test__b2, a1);

    if (b2->b) {
        ...
    }
}


----

=== Switch on type

The lib-common also provides helper to perform a switch/case-like matching for
classes. Two flavors are provided: `IOP_CLASS_SWITCH()` will enter the case of
the nearest parent of the provided instance and `IOP_CLASS_EXACT_SWITCH()` will
only match the case of the exact type of the provided instance. The matching
being done using a real switch/case construct, the native `case
IOP_CLASS_ID(type)` construct can be used to match a specific type. The
`default:` label can only be used with the `IOP_CLASS_EXACT_SWITCH()`.

Some helper macros are provided to perform both the matching and the cast of
the structure to the matched type. Those macros are `IOP_CLASS_CASE` and
`IOP_CLASS_CASE_CONST`. Additionally, `IOP_CLASS_DEFAULT()` is provided to be
used as a `default:` replacement in the `IOP_CLASS_SWITCH()`, its use is
mandatory: every `IOP_CLASS_SWITCH()` must have a `IOP_CLASS_DEFAULT()` case. A
`IOP_CLASS_EXACT_DEFAULT()` is also provided for the `IOP_CLASS_EXACT_SWITCH()`
variant, however it is not mandatory.

The `IOP_CLASS_SWITCH()` variant takes a name that must be repeated in the
`IOP_CLASS_DEFAULT()`, this name is used to allow several imbricated
`IOP_CLASS_SWITCH()`.

The switch must only contains cases for classes of the same inheritance tree as
the instance.

[source,c]
----

/* Example of IOP_CLASS_SWITCH */
IOP_CLASS_SWITCH(toto, my_instance) {
  IOP_CLASS_CASE(test__b1, my_instance, b1) {
    e_info("my_instance is a child of b1");
  }
  IOP_CLASS_CASE(test__b2, my_instance, b2) {
    e_info("my_instance is a child of b2");
  }
  IOP_CLASS_DEFAULT(toto) {
    e_info("my_instance is neither a child of b1, nor b2");
  }
}

/* Example of IOP_CLASS_EXACT_SWITCH */
IOP_CLASS_EXACT_SWITCH(my_instance) {
  IOP_CLASS_CASE(test__b1, my_instance, b1) {
    e_info("my_instance is an instance of b1");
  }
  IOP_CLASS_CASE(test__b2, my_instance, b2) {
    e_info("my_instance is an instance of b2");
  }
  IOP_CLASS_EXACT_DEFAULT() {
    e_info("my_instance is neither an instance of b1, nor b2");
  }
}

IOP_CLASS_EXACT_SWITCH(my_instance) {
  case IOP_CLASS_ID(test__b1):
    e_info("my_instance is an instance of b1");
    break;
  case IOP_CLASS_ID(test__b2):
    e_info("my_instance is an instance of b2");
    break;
  default:
    e_info("my_instance is neither an instance of b1, nor b2");
    break;
}

----

=== Binary packing/unpacking

First of all, the IOP packages containing classes definitions have to be
registered *before* trying to pack or unpack any class. This will also make the
class_id collision checks that were discussed above:

[source,c]
----

IOP_REGISTER_PACKAGES(&test__pkg);

----

Then, the binary packing/unpacking of a class object can be done with the
`*_bpack`/`*_bunpack_ptr` helpers.

When unpacking, a *double-pointer* on the destination object is given. It is
allocated (or reallocated). Here is a simple example of unpacking:

[source,c]
----

t_scope;
test__a1__t *foo = NULL;
pstream_t input = <get packed data from somewhere>;

if (iop_bunpack_ptr(t_pool(), &test__a1__s, (void **)&foo, input,
    false) < 0)
{
    /* error handling */
} else {
    /* successful unpack */
}

----

== Inheritance in Json

=== Json representation

In json, a class looks like a structure with the extra field _"_class"_. This
field contains the instanciated class fullname as a string.

Here is an example:
[source,json]
----

{
    "_class": "test.B1",
    "a": 20,
    "b": "blah"
}

----

Fields can be in any order, but unpacking will be more efficient if _"_class"_
is the first one.

=== Json packing/unpacking

Just as binary packing/unpacking, this is necessary to register the packages
containing classes with `IOP_REGISTER_PACKAGES`.

Then, the packing can be done as usual.  Unpacking have to be done using the
_*_ptr_ json helpers (usage is the same as for binary unpacking).

== Inheritance in XML

=== XML representation

In XML, a class looks like a structure, but the parent node contains the
attribute _"xsi:type"_ to specify the instanciated class type. The _"xsi"_
schema must be imported in the root node.

Here is an example:
[source,xml]
----

<root xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="n:test.B1">
  <a>20</a>
  <b>blah</b>
</root>

----

The order of the fields is important: the fields of the master class first,
and then the fields of the children.

The type can be omitted. In that case, the unpacker is considering that the
instanciated class is of the expected type.

=== XML packing/unpacking

Cf. binary/json packing/unpacking.

=== WSDL generation

The only thing to know is that this necessary to register packages containing
classes using `IOP_REGISTER_PACKAGES` before generating a WSDL of modules using
these classes with `iop_xwsdl`.

== Inheritance in PHP

In PHP, a class object is represented like a structure with a special field
_"_class"_ containing the instanciated class fullname as a string (like in
json).

== Inheritance in Python

=== Python representation

In Python, a class instance can simply be created using the iopy _Struct_
object, as for structures. For example, here is a valid declaration of an
instance of `classContainer`:

[source,python]
----

cc = ClassContainer(
        classContainerA1 = B2(a = 100, b = 0),
        classContainerB1 = B1(a = 100, b = "blah"),
        classContainerB2 = [
            B2(a = 101, b = 1),
            B2(a = 102, b = 0),
        ]
     )

----

=== RPC call

Let's suppose we have a RPC taking a class `A1` as argument:

[source,java]
----

  testClass2
    in  A1
    out void;

----

There are two ways to call this RPC in Python:

* If the argument is of type `A1` (and not one of his child), then it can be
  called as if it was a structure, by explicitly filling its fields:

[source,python]
----

testClass2(a = 5)

----

* If the argument is a child of `A1`, then it must be given using the following
  explicit syntax:

[source,python]
----

arg = B2(a = 100, b = 0)
testClass2(arg)

----

or simply:

[source,python]
----

testClass2(B2(a = 100, b = 0))

----

Calling a RPC taking a class container as argument can be done as usual, just
as if it was a simple structure.
