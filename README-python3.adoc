= Intersec Python 3 environment

== Introduction

This document presents how `Python 3` is used in `lib-common`.


== `Python 3` version

The supported version of `Python` is defined in `pyproject.toml` via `uv`.


== `uv`

With `Python 3`, in order to have a reproducible `Python` environment, we use
`uv`.

For a more general documentation about `uv`, see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/.


=== `uv` environment

==== `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`

`uv` is a tool that creates and manages a `virtualenv` in order to have a
reproducible Python environment.

`uv` uses two files to install/uninstall packages:

- `pyproject.toml`: This file contains the list of packages and their
  requirements (version, os, ...). The packages are basically separated in two
  categories, `dependency-groups.dev` and `dependencies`.
    * `dependency-groups.dev` contains the packages that are only used on
    development but not used on release.
    * `dependencies` contains the packages that are used both on development
    and on release.
  You should modify this file when you want to add or modify the Python
  packages.

- `uv.lock`: This file is automatically generated by `uv` when
  installing and updating packages.
  It contains the list of all the packages and their dependencies with their
  exact version and the hashes of the packages.
  It is this file that is actually used to install the Python packages in the
  `virtualenv`.

==== How to install new Python packages

To install a new package, you will need to list it in `pyproject.toml`.

First, you need to consider if your package will be used only on development,
or also on release. In the first case, the package needs to be placed in
`dependency-groups.dev` section, otherwise, you should put it in `dependencies`
section.

Then, unless you want to use a very specific version of your package, you
should look for the version of the package you want to use on
https://pypi.org/.

You must specify the version of the package you want to use along with a small
description about why you need this package.

When specifying the version, the use of `~=` is preferred over the `==`
identifier. See
https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/dependencies/#dependency-specifiers-pep-508.

After adding the new package in `pyproject.toml`, you must run `uv lock`
in order to install the new package and update `uv.lock`.
Then run `uv sync` to update the `virtualenv`.

==== How to update Python packages

In order to update all the packages and their dependencies according to the
packages requirements set in the `pyproject.toml` file, run the following
command:
----
uv lock --upgrade
----

This only updates `uv.lock`. Then run `uv sync` to update the `virtualenv`.

=== Waf and uv

In order to easily setup the `uv` environment, `Waf` will perform some
operations on configure and on build.

==== `waf configure` and `uv sync`

`Waf` will automatically install the `uv` environment with `uv sync`.

If `pyproject.toml` is out-of-sync with `uv.lock`, `waf configure` will
fail.

==== `/srv/tools` and `PYTHONPATH`

With `python3`, we don't want to use the outdated packages in
`/srv/tools/lib/python`.
However, we don't want to have to modify the PYTHONPATH environment variable
as we want to keep the compatibility with older branches.

The solution is to use a special `_intersec_no_srv_tools.pth` file in the
`uv` environment `site-packages` (see https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html).
Since it is internal to the `uv` environment, it does not pollute the
global system environment.

This `.pth` will automatically remove all directories from the `sys.path` that
starts with `/srv/tools`.

Consequently, we no longer use `iopy` from `/srv/tools` but directly from
the `lib-common` sub-module.
The path to `iopy` is automatically added to `sys.path` via the `.pth`.

Similarly, all calls to `ipath` have been removed and the paths to the
repository modules (`iopy`, ...) are added via the `.pth` file.

==== `Waf` in `uv` environment

To properly configure and build the products with the right version of
`Python` of the `uv` environment, `Waf` must actually be run within the
`uv` environment.

In order to make it easy to use and for the buildbots, `Waf` can still be used
outside the `uv` environment.
In that case, `Waf` will detect that we are not currently in the `uv`
environment, and will rerun itself in it.
This can be visualized with the following messages:
----
Waf: Entering directory `/home/buildbot/builds/review_centos7_waf/build/.build-waf-default'
Waf: Run waf in uv environment
Waf: Entering directory `/home/buildbot/builds/review_centos7_waf/build/.build-waf-default'
Waf: Selected profile: default
----


== `Pylint` and `uv`

With `python3`, we use a more recent version of `Pylint` than the one used for
`python2` branches. This means that the options and switches must be adapted
for `python3`.

To solve this issue, the global `pylintrc` has been copied to the root
repository directory and adapted for `python3`.

In order to use it with the proper `Python` version of the `uv`
environment, `Pylint` must be run at the root repository directory and with
`uv`:

----
$ uv run pylint tests/iopy/z_iopy.py

== Migrate `Python 2` code to `Python 3`

A wiki page is available that describes how to migrate `Python 2` code to
`Python 3`:
